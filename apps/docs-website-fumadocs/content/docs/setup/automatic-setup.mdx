# Automatic setup (recommended)

Let the CLI take care of everything!

<Steps>

1.  Just run this command in your terminal:

    ```package-install
    npm init @sherifforg/config
    ```

    Visit the [CLI docs](/docs/cli-usage/commands-reference#sherifforgcreate-config) for a detailed look at the available options.

      For monorepos, refer to the extra details in the [monorepo support](/docs/monorepo-support#setup-with-npm-init-sherifforgconfig) guide.
