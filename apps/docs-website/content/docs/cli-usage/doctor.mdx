The Doctor is a diagnostic tool that monitor your Sheriff configuration and ensure it stays up-to-date with your project dependencies.

## Example usecase

Picture this: you kickstart your project and opt for [jest](https://jestjs.io/) as your unit testing solution of choice. You setup Sheriff with the [Scaffolder](/docs/cli-usage/scaffolder) and it automatically enables the `jest` support for your project. All great.

But then, one day, you decide to switch to [vitest](https://vitest.dev/). You update your project dependencies and forget to update your Sheriff configuration.

**Here is where the Doctor comes into picture**: it will catch this mismatch and warn you about it, so you can readily turn off the `jest` support in your Sheriff configuration and turn on the `vitest` support.

All is good again.

## How to run it

<Steps>
  <Step>
  To get started, install it in your project:

  ```npm
  npm i -D @sherifforg/cli
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Add the command to your `package.json` scripts:

  ```json title="package.json"
  {
    "scripts": {
      "sheriff": "sheriff"
    }
  }
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
  And then run it:

  ```bash
  pnpm sheriff
  ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

It is advised to integrate the Doctor in your **CI pipelines**, but you can also integrate it into pre-commit hooks if that's your preference.

## How it works

The `sheriff` command will scan your project dependencies and your Sheriff configuration object. If Sheriff finds some dependencies that don't have the corresponding Sheriff options enabled, it will throw an error.

### Example

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1",
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warn" title="Warning">

The Doctor will scan the config file trying to find a variable named **exactly** `sheriffOptions`. If your configuration object variable is called in any other way, nothing will work. Make sure the variable is named `sheriffOptions`.

</Callout>

## Options

The Doctor is very flexible and offers a variety of options to customize it's behavior. Check out the [API reference](./commands-reference#sherifforgcli) for detailed info on the available options.

You can:

- skip the check for a specific dependency. This is useful in scenarios where the mismatch is intended, meaning that you don't want Sheriff linting support for a specific dependency even if Sheriff support is available
- let the process finish without throwing erros even if problems with the dependencies are found. In this case the Doctor will just signal problems as warnings
