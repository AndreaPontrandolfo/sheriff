This config is opinionated and complex, so make sure to meet the [hard requirements](/docs/requirements/hard-requirements) in
your project. Then, let the Scaffolder handle the whole setup for you automatically,
or do it yourself manually.

For greenfield projects that lack a ESLint config, the below setup options will be enough.
However, for established codebases that already have a ESLint config setup, you should also follow the instructions
for the [migration path](/docs/migration-guide).
