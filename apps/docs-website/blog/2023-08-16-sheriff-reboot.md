# Sheriff has a New Home

A new home has been found for the Sheriff ESLint sharable config! With a complete rebranding, a restructured codebase, and exciting plans ahead, Sheriff is set to become an even more essential tool for ensuring code quality and consistency in projects.

## Restructured Codebase in a Monorepo

One of the most significant changes in this release is the restructuring of the codebase into a monorepo. This decision was driven by a commitment to making Sheriff more modular, maintainable, and adaptable. The monorepo setup allows for the management of multiple related packages under a single repository, streamlining the development process and enabling better coordination between different parts of the project.

This change offers a myriad of benefits. It promotes code sharing, reduces duplication, and simplifies the release process. Each individual package within the monorepo is now independently versioned, ensuring that updates are more targeted and controlled. As a result, Sheriff becomes more flexible and can better accommodate various project setups and configurations.

## Complete Rebranding

### New Documentation with Docusaurus

A new documentation hub was crafted, leveraging the power of Docusaurus, a modern documentation framework. This hub provides users with clear, concise, and actionable information. Whether a newcomer or a seasoned user, the revamped documentation guides through the installation process, configuration options, and advanced features of Sheriff.

Docusaurus ensures that the documentation is user-friendly and responsive while allowing for easy maintenance and updates. It's a key component in the efforts to make Sheriff's documentation a valuable resource for anyone looking to leverage the power of this ESLint sharable config.

### New Logo

The beginning of a fresh era for Sheriff is marked by a new logo. The logo captures the essence of the tool - strong, reliable, and always vigilant. Just like a diligent sheriff maintaining law and order, the updated logo reflects Sheriff's commitment to keeping codebases clean and consistent.

### New Blog

A brand-new blog is being introduced to keep users up-to-date with the latest developments, tutorials, and insights. This blog will feature articles that dive deep into Sheriff's features, showcase real-world use cases, and explore best practices for integrating Sheriff into workflows. The blog is a space where the passion for clean code can be shared and help users make the most of Sheriff in their projects.

## What's Next

With Sheriff's new home and rejuvenated identity, excitement abounds about the road ahead. The focus remains on continuously improving the tool, making it more adaptable, and responding to the evolving needs of the development community.

In the coming months, look forward to:

- **Astro Support**: Work is being done to introduce support for Astro, allowing seamless integration of Sheriff into Astro projects for enhanced code quality.
- **Searchbar Powered by Algolia**: A powerful searchbar powered by Algolia is being introduced to help users quickly locate relevant information in the documentation.
- **Ask AI Feature**: An Ask AI feature is being developed to provide instant answers and suggestions based on user queries, making the experience with Sheriff even smoother.

## Conclusion

The new home of Sheriff in a monorepo, complete with its rebranding efforts, signifies a bold step forward for the project. As this journey unfolds, the commitment to enhancing code quality, consistency, and developer experience remains unwavering. With a new documentation hub powered by Docusaurus, logo, and blog in place, Sheriff is set to provide an even more exceptional ESLint sharable config experience.

Being part of the Sheriff community is appreciated. It's exciting to see how Sheriff will be used to create cleaner, more maintainable code in projects. Stay tuned for more updates, tutorials, and insights on the brand-new blog!
