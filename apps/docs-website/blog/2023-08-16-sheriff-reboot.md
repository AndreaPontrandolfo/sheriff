# A new home for Sheriff

Sheriff, the ESLint sharable config, has exciting news to share!<br />
With a complete rebranding, a restructured codebase, and exciting plans ahead, Sheriff is set to become an even more essential tool for ensuring code quality and consistency in projects.<br />
Here's a snapshot of the key changes:

## Restructured Codebase in a monorepo

The codebase has been restructured into a monorepo setup, as it allows for the management of multiple related packages under a single repository, streamlining the development process and enabling better coordination between different parts of the project.

## Complete Rebranding

### New documentation

The documentation has been fully revamped, moving on from a simple README to a full-blown website, a new documentation hub was crafted, leveraging the power of [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern documentation framework. Whether a newcomer or a seasoned user, the documentation is more accessible and easier to navigate, with a sidebar that allows for quick access to the different sections.<br/>
Also, a special ["Rules"](../docs/rules) page was carefully crafted to let users explore in detail all the rules that Sheriff enables.

### New Logo

The beginning of a fresh era for Sheriff is marked by a new logo, that features the iconic ESLint logo and a shield.

### New Blog

A brand-new blog is now available, where I'll keep sharing updates on the projects as it grows along.

## What's Next

With Sheriff's new home and rejuvenated identity, The focus remains on continuously improving the tool, making it more adaptable, and responding to the evolving needs of the development community.<br />
Looking ahead, several exciting developments are in store:

- **Astro Support**: In the continuous effort to integrate more eslint-plugins into Sheriff, the next in line is [eslint-plugin-astro](https://github.com/ota-meshi/eslint-plugin-astro).
- **Searchbar**: full-text search, powered by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) in the new docs.
- **Ask AI**: along with the new searchbar will come an "Ask AI bot" feature. Details on this one are still being worked on.

## Conclusion

With this much-needed facelift, Sheriff is ready to keep growing. With a new documentation hub powered by Docusaurus, logo, and blog in place, Sheriff is set to provide an even more exceptional ESLint sharable config experience.<br/>
