This release introduces key updates to Sheriff:

## ESLint V9 APIs Compatibility
Sheriff now fully supports ESLint V9 APIs for all plugins. [Milestone](https://github.com/AndreaPontrandolfo/sheriff/milestone/1?closed=1).

There were some [problematic](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/28313) plugins that could cause crashes in some instances, like [eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) and [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/tree/main).

Now every plugin is updated to the V9 compatible version and all issues should be resolved.

## Added `eslint-plugin-remeda`
Added support for [remeda](https://github.com/remeda/remeda) with [eslint-plugin-remeda](https://github.com/AndreaPontrandolfo/eslint-plugin-remeda).

If you use Remeda instead of Lodash, you should now disable `lodash` in the config and enable `remeda`.

```js title="eslint.config.js"
import sheriff from "eslint-config-sheriff";
import { defineFlatConfig } from "eslint-define-config";

const sheriffOptions = {
  react: false,
  next: false,
  astro: false,
  // highlight-start
  lodash: false,
  remeda: true,
// highlight-end
  playwright: false,
  jest: false,
  vitest: false,
};

export default defineFlatConfig([...sheriff(sheriffOptions)]);
```

## Unified Type Exports
The types previously exported from `@sherifforg/types` are now exported directly from `eslint-config-sheriff`.

The `@sherifforg/types` package is now deprecated, users can now safely remove it and update the imports accordingly.

## Compliance with the native typescript support for the `eslint.config.ts` file

Sheriff moved away from [eslint-ts-patch](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-ts-patch) and adopted the [native support for TypeScript](https://eslint.org/blog/2024/08/eslint-v9.9.0-released/#experimental-typescript-configuration-files) in the `eslint.config.ts` file.

You can enable it by setting `unstable_ts_config`, both in the CLI commands and in the [VSCode extension settings](https://www.eslint-config-sheriff.dev/docs/vscode-support#eslintconfigts-support).

## New syntax for boostrapping Sheriff projects

Now you can do `pnpm create @sherifforg/config` instead of `pnpm dlx create-sheriff-config` to bootstrap a new Sheriff project.

## Minor improvements

- Astro linting is now configurable
- the SheriffOptions object is now optional, if you don't specify it, every option will be passed as `false` by default.
- general fixes and improvements to the cli. The experience should be much better now.
