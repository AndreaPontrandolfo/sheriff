# eslint.config.ts

The `eslint.config.ts` file is a Typescript-enabled version of the `eslint.config.js` file.

If you go through the [automatic setup](../setup/automatic-setup.mdx) of Sheriff, at some point the wizard will ask you if you want to setup Sheriff with a `eslint.config.ts` file instead of the default `eslint.config.js` file. Choose `yes` if you want to have a typesafe ESLint configuration file.

Instead, if you choose the manual installation, follow the instruction in the [manual setup page](../setup/manual-setup.mdx).

Also check the specific docs for the [VSCode integration](../vscode-support.md#eslintconfigts-support).

:::warning

This feature is available only with ESLint version `>=9.9.0`.
