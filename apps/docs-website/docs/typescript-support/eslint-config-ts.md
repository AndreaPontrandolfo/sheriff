# `eslint.config.ts`

The `eslint.config.ts` file is a TypeScript-enabled version of the `eslint.config.js` file.

If you go through the [automatic setup](../setup/automatic-setup.mdx) of Sheriff, at some point the wizard will ask you if you want to set up Sheriff with a `eslint.config.ts` file instead of the default `eslint.config.js` file. Choose `yes` if you want to have a typesafe ESLint configuration file.

Instead, if you choose the manual installation, follow the instruction in the [manual setup page](../setup/manual-setup.mdx).

Also check the specific docs for the [VS Code integration](../vscode-support.md#eslintconfigts-support).

For more details, checkout [the official ESLint documentation on the topic](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#typescript-configuration-files).

:::warning

This feature is available only with ESLint version `>=9.9.0`.
