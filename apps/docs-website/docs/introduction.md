## What is Sheriff?

Sheriff is a comprehensive ESLint configuration that supports [many popular technologies](./techs.md).

:::warning

Sheriff is a TypeScript-first library, and as such, only supports TypeScript codebases written with modern ECMAScript standards. Vanilla JavaScript codebases are not supported for now. See the [FAQ](./faq.md#does-sheriff-support-vanilla-javascript-codebases).

## Key points

- This library is pioneering in the adoption of the ESLint‚Äôs flat configuration system, [introduced in ESLint v8.23.0](https://eslint.org/blog/2022/08/eslint-v8.23.0-released/)
- Sheriff is easy to both set up and use. It promotes a _‚Äúzero overhead approach‚Äù_. See: [philosophy](./core-philosophy/criteria.md)
- Sheriff is a [_‚Äúplug & play‚Äù_](./setup/automatic-setup.mdx) solution, but you can still customize it as much as you want. See: [features](./features.md)

## Trivia

The name ‚ÄúSheriff‚Äù comes from the idea that it‚Äôs a tool that watches over your codebase to keep everything in order.
