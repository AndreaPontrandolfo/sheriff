# üõ†Ô∏è Setup

This config is opinionated and complex, so make sure to meet the [hard requirements](../requirements/hard-requirements.md) in
your project. Then, let `create-sheriff-config` handle the whole setup for you automatically,
or do it yourself manually. <br />
For greenfield projects that lack a ESLint config, the below setup options will be enough.
However, for established codebases that already have a ESLint config setup, you should also follow the instructions
for the [migration path](../migration-guide.mdx).
