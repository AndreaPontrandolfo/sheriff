# üõ†Ô∏è Setup

This config is opinionated and complex, so make sure to meet the [hard requirements](../requirements/hard-requirements.md) in
your project. Then, let `create-sheriff-config` handle the whole setup for you automatically,
or do it yourself manually. <br />
For greenfield projects, the below setup will be enough.
However, for already established codebases, you should also follow the instructions
for the [migration path](../migration-guide.md).
