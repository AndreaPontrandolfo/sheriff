# üõ†Ô∏è Setup

This config is opinionated and complex, so make sure your project meets the [hard requirements](../requirements/hard-requirements.md). Then, let `@sherifforg/cli` handle the setup for you automatically, or do it yourself manually.<br />
For greenfield projects that lack a ESLint config, the setup options listed below will be enough. However, for established codebases that already have an ESLint config setup, you should also follow the instructions for the [migration path](../migration-guide.mdx).
