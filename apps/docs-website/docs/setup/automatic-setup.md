# Automatic setup (recommended)

Let the CLI take care of everything!

1. Just run this command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   ❯  npx create-sheriff-config
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   ❯  pnpx create-sheriff-config
   ```

2. [Setup VSCode support](../vscode-support.md) (_optional_)

...and you are good to go! Happy hacking 🎉
