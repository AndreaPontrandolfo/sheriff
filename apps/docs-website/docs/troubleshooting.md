# ðŸ©¹ Troubleshooting

## The command `yarn create @sherifforg/config` fails when using yarn

Depending on the context and under specific conditions, the setup command may fail to install the dependencies when using `yarn`. <br />
In this case you can simply install them yourself. The `yarn create @sherifforg/config` command should spit out the correct command prompt for you to do so at the end of the process. If that doesn't happen, refer to the [manual setup instructions](./setup/manual-setup.mdx).

Alternatively, consider switching package manager to [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

## My editor feels slow

Make sure to read the appropriate docs [here](./performance-considerations.mdx).
