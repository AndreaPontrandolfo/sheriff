## `create-sheriff-config` fails when using yarn

Depending on the context and under specific conditions, `create-sheriff-config` may fail to install the dependencies when using `yarn`. <br />
In this case you can simply install them yourself. The `create-sheriff-config` process should spit out the correct command prompt for you to do so. If that doesn't happen, refer to the [manual setup instructions](./setup/manual-setup.md).

Alternatively, consider switching package manager to [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).
