## Why you didnâ€™t include ESLint plugins/rules for "X" library?

- [Cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/eslint-plugin-cypress) âžœ Don't use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). Use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) instead.
- [Testing library](https://github.com/testing-library/eslint-plugin-testing-library) âžœ I believe Sheriff should not encourage wrong testing practices. In my opinion [testing library](https://github.com/testing-library) is one of the least efficient ways to test UIs, by principles. In most codebases it does more harm than good. You can use [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook) to test components in isolation and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for any kind of integration and end-to-end tests.

## Is Sheriff compatible with "X"?

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) âžœ Yes.
- [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) âžœ Yes. Sheriff has explicit support for Next.js. You can enable it in the Sheriff config options.
- [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/) âžœ Yes. Just add this line to your `.env` file:

  ```.env title=".env"
  DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN=true
  ```

- [Rome](https://rome.tools/) âžœ No. Rome is not compatible with ESLint in the first place.
- [Deno](https://deno.land/) âžœ No. Deno is not compatible with ESLint in the first place.
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) âžœ Untested.

## Does Sheriff support vanilla Javascript codebases?

Sheriff is a Typescript-first ESLint configuration. It's focused on Typescript codebases. You can almost consider Sheriff a superset of [@typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io/). <br />
If your codebase is not written in Typescript, you should would worry about that first, before worrying about linting.

For this reason, vanilla Javascript is not supported as of right now, but support may come at a later time.
