# ðŸ’… Prettier support

Sheriff tries to incorporate [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) out-of-the-box.

## Setup

The `create-sheriff-config` command will spin up for you a default `.prettierrc.json` configuration. You _can_ modify it if you need to, but [it is discouraged](https://prettier.io/docs/en/option-philosophy.html). Act with caution.

If you don't use the `create-sheriff-config` command, you will have to provide a prettier config yourself. Also don't forget the [`.prettierignore` file](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html).

If you already have a Prettier config in your project, you are good to go. The `create-sheriff-config` command won't create a new Prettier config, nor will attempt to modify the existing one.

## Usage

By design, Sheriff **doesn't** incorporate:

- [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier). Its use is discouraged by the Prettier team itself, [as it just slows down your editor](https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html#notes). It's better to just let ESLint and Prettier run side-by-side.
- [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier). Starting from ESLint v8.53.0, [ESLint stopped shipping formatting rules](https://eslint.org/blog/2023/10/deprecating-formatting-rules/), and shortly after `@typesript/eslint` followed suit. This change made `eslint-config-prettier` completely irrelevant and now the only formatting rules left in Sheriff are `@stylistic/padding-line-between-statements` and `curly`, which don't conflict with Prettier.

Instead, for your local editing experience, it's recommended to install the [Prettier editor extension](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html).<br />
If you want to enforce Prettier at pre-commit stage, see the [official Prettier docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit).<br />
To enforce Prettier in CI, see the [Prettier CLI docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html).
