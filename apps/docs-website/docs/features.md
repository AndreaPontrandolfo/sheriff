# ✨ Features

- ⚡ **Batteries included**: Sheriff is a all-in-one solution. You don't need to install or configure separately anything else. Everything is included here.
- 🔓 **No lock-in**: Sheriff is not a framework. You can extend the `eslint.config.js` beyond Sheriff as much as you like, just like you normally would. Or you can disable any rule Sheriff comes with. Sheriff doesn't impose any limitation. See: [configuration](./configuration.md).
- 🏑 **Frictionless by design**: to setup Sheriff and take off, the only input required from the user is running the command `npx create-sheriff-config`. The command will automatically infer the details of your project and figure out the optimal Sheriff configuration by itself.
- ⇆ **Interoperability**: you can plop Sheriff in your project at any moment. `create-sheriff-config` will config automatically everything for you and will warn you if you need to take any special precautions. Bottom line: it's never too late to install Sheriff.
- 🏔 **Cutting-edge**: Sheriff is one of the first attempts in the wild to adhere to the new eslint configuration format, the `FlatConfig`. You can use Sheriff to easily and safely migrate your project to the new config format without effort. See: [migration guide](./migration-guide.md).
- 👊 **Sensible**: Almost all of the rules that were hand-picked in Sheriff were chosen to counter some problematic real-world scenarios that can occur in production projects and to ensure maximum style consistency. No bloat here.
- 🗄️ **Configurable**: Sheriff is fully configurable with its own config object. See: [configuration](./configuration.md).
- 🐙 **Modular**: Sheriff has opt-in support for a [wide array of libraries](./techs.md).
- ✍ **SemVer**: Sheriff [releases](https://github.com/AndreaPontrandolfo/sheriff/releases) follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standards.
