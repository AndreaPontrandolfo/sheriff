description: ðŸŽ¯ What line of reasoning drives Sheriff development

# Criteria

This library is very opinionated, but for the better. A lot of decisions were taken so you don't have to.<br />
You can now quickstart static analysis in all your TypeScript projects with ease.<br />
Just type `npm init @sherifforg/config` in a CLI and you are good to go.

Ease of use without compromises is the top priority of Sheriff. The basic principle behind many design decisions of Sheriff is to require as less inputs from the user as possible.<br />
You can think of Sheriff like Prettier. Itâ€™s a tool that comes battery-packed with optimal defaults. It removes configuration decisions from the equation, so you or your team can focus on developing the actual product.<br />
If you disagree with something, you can easily override it, and you can extend it just as easily. See: [configuration](../configuration.mdx).

This config is particularly useful for big teams with developers of various skill levels.<br />
Sheriff was made to prevent all kinds of mistakes by aligning teams on the playing field. It is battle-tested in real-world scenarios and shines especially in such.<br />
Also, Sheriff targets pretty much everybody. Junior developers can learn a lot by using it, and team leads can save a lot of time on configuration and maintenance.

Sheriff doesnâ€™t aim to include every single ESLint plugin in existence. The ESLint plugins that qualify for inclusion in Sheriff are usually the ones that would benefit the community the most and that would be tricky to manually integrate with the rest of the config.
