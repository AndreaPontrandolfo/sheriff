# Criteria

This library is very opinionated, but it's for the better. I took a lot of decisions so you don't have to.<br />
You can now quickstart static analysis in all your Typescript projects with ease. Just type `create-sheriff-config` in a CLI and you are good to go.<br />
You can think of Sheriff like `prettier` or `create-react-app`. It's a tool that comes battery-packed with optimal defaults. It removes configuration decisions from the equation, so you or your team can focus on developing the actual product.<br />
And if you don't like something, you can easily override it, and just as easily you can extend it. See: [configuration](#configuration).

This config is particularly useful for big teams with developers of various skill levels.<br /> Sheriff was made to prevent all kind of mistakes and to align the team on the same playing field. It is battle-tested in real-world scenarios and shines especially in such.
