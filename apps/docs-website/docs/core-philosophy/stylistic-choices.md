# Stylistic choices

- no classes

  - Sheriff is trying to promote a "light functional" approach. Javascript classes don't fit such design.
- no reduce

- no overloads
  - generics supersedes them. overloads are a legacy feature that was made available in Typescript before generics were a thing. Overloads are mostly a C#/Angular leftover. Simply put: there are no problems that function overloads solve better than generics.
  - overloads clutter the code and make it more verbose and harder to read, which increase the cognitive overload.
  - overloads clutter the VScode tooltips.
  - overloads force you to write non-standard javascript syntax.
  - overloads are a bad practice. The flexibility that they enable also enable your team to write inconsistent code. Which is exactly the problem that Eslint is designed to solve.
