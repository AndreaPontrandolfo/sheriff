# Why

Managing a complex Eslint configuration takes time and effort. **Sheriff does it for you.**

There are a lot of factors to take into considerations when you want to tackle a complex Eslint configuration.<br />
It requires a lot of expertise into a multitude of Javascript libraries, their nuances, and the interlacing between their behaviours.<br />
And it's a huge burden to mantain it.

With Sheriff, mantaining the Eslint configuration is as simple as updating Sheriff to the latest version.
