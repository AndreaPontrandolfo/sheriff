# Why

Managing a complex ESLint configuration takes time and effort. **Sheriff does it for you.**

There are a lot of factors to take into consideration when you want to tackle writing a complex ESLint configuration.<br />
It requires a lot of expertise into the JavaScript engines and the multitude of JavaScript libraries, their nuances, and the interlacing between their behaviors.

_And_, it's a huge burden to maintain it.

With Sheriff, maintaining the ESLint configuration is as simple as updating Sheriff to the latest version.
