# Why

Managing a complex ESLint configuration takes time and effort. **Sheriff does it for you.**

There are a lot of factors to take into considerations when you want to tackle a complex ESLint configuration.<br />
It requires a lot of expertise into a multitude of Javascript libraries, their nuances, and the interlacing between their behaviours.

_And_ it's a huge burden to mantain it.

With Sheriff, mantaining the ESLint configuration is as simple as updating Sheriff to the latest version.
