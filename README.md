## <a name="description"></a>📖 Description

`sheriff` is a comprehensive Eslint configuration.<br>
It takes into account various technologies (see: [techs](#techs)).<br>

> ⚠️ At the moment, `sheriff` supports only Typescript codebases with modern Ecmascript standards. Maybe in the future i'll take in consideration support for vanilla Javascript. Refer to the [roadmap](#roadmap).

## <a name="philosophy"></a>💭 Philosophy / Why / Motivations

This library is very opinionated, but it's for the better. I took a lot of decisions so you don't have to [^2]. You can now quickstart static analysis in all your Typescript projects with ease. It's just 1 `npm install`.<br>
You can think of `sheriff` like `prettier` or `create-react-app`. It's a tool that comes battery-packed with optimal defaults. It remove configuration decisions from the equation, so you or your team can focus on developing the actual product.<br>
And if you don't like something, you can easily override it, and just as easily you can extend it (see: [usage](#usage)).

[^2]: This config is particularly useful for big teams with developers of various skill levels. I worked in a lot of different projects and teams through the years and i got accustomed to seeing all kinds of mistake being made. `sheriff` was made to prevent all of those mistakes. It is battle-tested in real-world scenarios, and shines especially in such.

## <a name="installation"></a>🛠️ Installation

```bash
# npm
❯  npm install -D eslint-config-sheriff

# yarn
❯  yarn add -D eslint-config-sheriff

# pnpm
❯  pnpm add -D eslint-config-sheriff
```

## <a name="usage"></a>✨ Usage

This config is **highly** opinionated, so make sure to meet the [hard requirements](#hard-requirements) in your project.
Then, follow these steps:

1. [Install](#installation) the package from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-sheriff).
2. Create a `eslint.config.js` [^1] file and copy/paste the contents of this snippet:

   ```js
   // eslint.config.js

   import sheriff from 'eslint-config-sheriff/recommended';

   export default [
     ...sheriff,
     {
       files: ['**/*{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
     },
   ];
   ```

   or, if you already have a `eslint.config.js` in your project, just append `sheriff` to the configs array, like this:

   ```js
   // eslint.config.js

   import sheriff from 'eslint-config-sheriff/recommended';
   // my other imports...

   export default [
     // my other configurations...
     ...sheriff,
   ];
   ```

3. Configure `sheriff` as desired in the `sheriff.config.js` file. (_optional_)
4. Override any sheriff rule as desired in the `eslint.config.js` file. (_optional_)

[^1]: `sheriff` is based on the [new format of Eslint configs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files-new). You cannot extend `sheriff` from a [old config format](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files), it wouldn't work.

For some of this config i partially used [eslint-config-red](https://github.com/GrosSacASac/JavaScript-Set-Up/blob/master/js/red-javascript-style-guide/index.js) as a base.<br>
I don't take any attribution for the rules in the various eslint-plugins used here. Please consider starring the respective projects for the awesome work their authors made. The full list of the plugins used is [here](#eslint-plugins).
