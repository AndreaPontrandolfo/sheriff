## 💌 Acknowledgments

For some of this config i partially used [eslint-config-red](https://github.com/GrosSacASac/JavaScript-Set-Up/blob/master/js/red-javascript-style-guide/index.js) as a base.<br>
Also took inspiration from [eslint-config-airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb) for some of the rules in `no-restricted-syntax`.<br>
I don't take any attribution for the rules in the various eslint-plugins used here (except for the few that I personally created). Please consider starring the respective projects for the awesome work their authors made. Sheriff wouldn't be possible without their efforts. <br>
The full list of the plugins used is [here](https://www.eslint-config-sheriff.dev/docs/eslint-plugins).
